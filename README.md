# Origin51

Client Wholesale page Build.

This is bootstrapped with `npx create-react-app` then further created through the Shopify Storefront SDK. 

Shopify utilizes Graphql which the SDK pulls product information from. Through the use of a React Context, this site builds a functional cart, and product selection, then the consumer will procceed to the Shopify Checkout.
